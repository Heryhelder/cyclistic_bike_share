# Cyclistic Bike Share

## Intro
Cyclistic (fictitious name) has a bike sharing system. It has two types of users: **casual users**, who can pay per day of use or for each use of the bicycles, and **member users**, who pay annually to use the bicycles.

The focus of this analysis is to see the difference between the use of the service by different types of users to develop a marketing campaign focused on converting casual users into members.

All the code is in **cyclistic_bike_share.ipynb** (Python/Jupyter notebook) file
